AIM/OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
The Python Phonebook Project is a user-friendly contact management application developed using the Tkinter library. The primary aim of this project is to provide a simple and efficient way for users to store, manage, and retrieve contact information, including names, phone numbers, and addresses.

KEY FEATURES: 
1.	User Interaction: The application is designed to facilitate easy interaction with users through a graphical user interface (GUI). Users can input contact details via text fields and buttons, making the process intuitive and straightforward.
2.	Data Management: The project allows users to:
•	Add Contacts: Users can enter new contact information and save it to the phonebook.
•	View Contacts: Users can select a contact from the list to view its details, which are displayed in the input fields for easy editing.
•	Delete Contacts: Users can remove unwanted contacts from the list, ensuring that their phonebook remains organized and up-to-date.
•	Reset Fields: Users can clear all input fields to start fresh, enhancing usability.
3.	Efficient Storage: The contact information is stored in a list structure (datas), which allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of data. Each contact is represented as a sub-list containing the name, phone number, and address.
4.	Dynamic Updates: The application dynamically updates the contact list displayed in the GUI whenever a user adds or deletes a contact. This real-time feedback ensures that users are always aware of the current state of their phonebook.
5.	Educational Tool: This project serves as an educational example for beginners learning Python and GUI development. It demonstrates essential programming concepts such as event-driven programming, data handling, and the use of libraries to create interactive applications.
